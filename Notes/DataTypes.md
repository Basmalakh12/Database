# MySQL Data Types

- Each column in a database table is required to have a name and a data type.
- In MySQL there are three main data types: string, numeric, and date and time.

## SQL Constraints

- NOT NULL: Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
- UNIQUE: Ensures that all values in a column are different
- PRIMARY KEY: A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table
- FOREIGN KEY: Prevents actions that would destroy links between tables
- CHECK: Ensures that the values in a column satisfies a specific condition
- DEFAULT: Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified
- CREATE INDEX: Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly
